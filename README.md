# cryptsytrader

I wrote this bot a few years ago to try my hand a auto-trading in the
crypto-currency markets.

It did not make me rich, but I was also trading peanuts... I don't think it lost
me money during the time I was running it.

[Cryptsy, though, is a different story...](http://www.cryptsysettlement.com/).

It's not well documented, but maybe it'd be useful for you and the bot you're
working on.

Learning/implementing the algorithms was a good learning experience for me!

Check out `src/screenlog.0` for printouts of the bot actually running... I'll
leave it up to you to figure out if I was earning or losing money. :)
